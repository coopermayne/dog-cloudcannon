questions:
- question: What was the outcome of my case?
  answer: 'Within 30 days (but typically sooner than that), you will be mailed a letter
    from the Department’s General Manager as to the outcome of the case.  A full copy
    of the Hearing Examiner’s report will also be enclosed.

'
- question: I’m a dog owner and I’ve received Terms, Conditions, and Restrictions
    from a hearing.  What does this mean?
  answer: Short answer
- question: What happens if I do not comply with the TCR issued to me?
  answer: 'If you are alleged to be in violation of the TCR issued to you from a first
    hearing, the Department can request another administrative hearing.  The purpose
    of that hearing would be to determine if your animal license should be revoked
    for failure to abide by the TCR.  If you are found to be in violation at the second
    hearing, your license can be revoked; or, alternatively, your license can be reissued
    with additional or different TCR.

'
- question: Who can I contact if I have questions about the TCR I was issued or if
    I’m having trouble complying?
  answer: |
    Call your local LA Animal Services center if you have any questions or are having trouble complying.  The Department aims to promote responsible pet ownership and wants to help pet owners to that end.
    The letter from the Department General Manager issuing your TCR should have the contact information for your neighborhood’s animal services center.  If you do not have that information available, go to this page on the Department’s website, then click “Shelter Lookup” to find your local Animal Services center.
- question: What does it mean to have my dog license revoked?
  answer: 'A revoked license means that your dog must be removed from the City of
    Los Angeles.  It further prohibits you from maintaining any dog in the City of
    Los Angeles for three years.  Failure to remove a dog from the City after its
    license has been revoked is a criminal misdemeanor.

'
- question: Can I appeal the Department’s decision?
  answer: 'Yes. Respondents can appeal the Department’s decision.  Only the Respondent
    (the pet owner) has a right to appeal.  Appeals are heard by the Department of
    Animal Services’ Board of Commissioners. [ More info ](#appeal-procedure)

# Terms, Conditions, and Restrictions
This means that you keep your license to keep an own a dog or other animal in the City, subject to complying with the terms, conditions and restrictions the Department has ordered.

“Terms, Conditions or Restrictions” (TCR) are authorized by Section 53.34.4(e)(2) of Los Angeles Municipal Code.  The Department issues TCR after a hearing determined your animal was not “dangerous.”  The Department also determined that you were “able and willing to properly train, handle or maintain the . . . animal and a similar incident is not likely to occur in the future with proper training, handling, or maintenance.”

Common TCR may include, but are not limited to, requirements that you:
- Post warning signs (or additional signs) on entrances to your property.
- Make changes to fencing, gates, etc. of your property to better confine your animal, and allow for a post-hearing inspection of the animal’s confinement on your property.
- Obtain additional behavior training.
- Utilize certain types or methods of restraining or muzzling your animal.
- Not transfer custody or ownership of your animal without the express consent of the Department’s General Manager.
- Maintain a minimum amount of liability insurance.
Obtain and pay the fee for a Restricted Dog permit.

# Appeal Procedure

When the Department mails its notice of the outcome of the case, an appeal form is included with instructions.  If you wish to appeal the decision, you must submit the form in writing within 15 days of having received it.
Bear in mind there are only two reasons that can be the basis for an appeal:

1. You believe the decision is not supported by the evidence presented in the case, or
2. The hearing was not conducted in accordance with the law regarding the hearing process (the text of that law, Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 53.18.5, can be found [HERE](http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/California/lamc/municipalcode/chaptervpublicsafetyandprotection/article3animalsandfowls?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:losangeles_ca_mc$anc=JD_53.18.5.).
