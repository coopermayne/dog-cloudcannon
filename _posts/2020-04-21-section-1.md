questions:
- question: Why am I being summoned by the Los Angeles Department of Animal Services?
  answer: It has been alleged that an animal injured a person or another animal, and/or
    caused property damage within the City of Los Angeles.  The Department believes
    you are either the victim of such an incident, or the owner of the animal involved
    in the incident(s), or a witness to the incident(s).  You are being summoned to
    appear and testify at a hearing regarding the incident(s).  Per Los Angeles Municipal
    Code Section 53.34.4, the Department must conduct a hearing to determine whether
    the animal poses a threat to public safety.
- question: What is the purpose of the hearing?
  answer: The hearing is a semi-judicial proceeding – something of an informal trial.  It
    aims solely to gather evidence to ultimately determine whether the animal in question
    can safely be maintained in the City of Los Angeles.  The hearing is only concerned
    with public safety and welfare – it does not address potential claims for money
    damages or other matters that would be reserved for civil litigation.  The hearing
    is a public proceeding – anyone may attend and the audio of the proceedings is
    recorded.

    floor.  Plan to arrive 15 minutes in advance of your hearing time to allow time
    to check-in with Department staff.'

# Hearing Procedure

The hearing is conducted by a Hearing Examiner appointed by the General Manager of the Department.  The Hearing Examiner will begin by reading an opening statement informing the parties of the procedures for the hearing and basic terminology.  The Examiner will also administer an oath to everyone present who intends to testify.  All testimony given must be the truth; lying while under oath is perjury, a criminal offense.  For the hearing, the alleged victim is referred to as the “Complaining Witness” and the animal owner is referred to as the “Respondent.”

The Examiner will then begin asking questions to the Complaining Witness.  Some of the questions the Hearing Examiner asks will be based upon a document called “Exhibit 1.”  Exhibit 1 is a summary of the preliminary investigation of the incident conducted by a Department Animal Control Officer.  (Animal owners should receive an advance copy of Exhibit 1 in the mail with their summons.  If you are a Respondent in an upcoming hearing and did not receive a copy of Exhibit 1, YOU CAN REQUEST ONE HERE.  The Complaining Witness may also submit any additional relevant photographs or documents during this time.  Finally, the Respondent will have an opportunity to cross-examine the Complaining Witness. 

This process will be repeated with any additional witnesses who plan to testify on behalf of the Complaining Witness.  Finally, the Hearing Examiner will ask questions of the Respondent, and the Complaining Witness will have an opportunity to cross-examine them afterward.  The process will be repeated for any additional witnesses who plan to testify on behalf of the Respondent.   Because the Respondent and their animal are presumed innocent until proven otherwise, the Respondent may choose not to testify at all if they feel that insufficient evidence has been presented against them.
