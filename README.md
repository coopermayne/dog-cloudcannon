# How this works

Code lives here on github. Admins can update posts and upload files on [Siteleaf][https://www.siteleaf.com/]

Siteleaf will push changes to this repo. Any change to this repo will trigger a rebuild at [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).

Static site is built in ~20sec. Site is currently [here](https://heuristic-mcclintock-265eb7.netlify.app/)

# Content Management

You only need to edit Posts...

To add images you just use the image uploader included with Siteleaf CMS. But note that all images are optional to the layout.

To find icons you can look through [feather icons](https://feathericons.com/). You can use any other these icons by simply referring to the icon name in the relevant Siteleaf sections.
